# Fastpath

**Optimization Backbone for Sodium: renderer, chunks, entities, particles, and light updates.**

Fastpath is a performance-focused companion mod designed to supercharge [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric) by optimizing the most demanding aspects of Minecraft‚Äôs rendering and simulation pipeline. Acting as a streamlined optimization backbone, Fastpath enhances efficiency across:

- **Renderer** ‚Äì Reduces redundant calculations and memory overhead for smoother frame delivery.  
- **Chunks** ‚Äì Parallelized and intelligently scheduled updates to minimize stutter when exploring new terrain.  
- **Entities** ‚Äì Smarter culling and update routines ensure only relevant entities are processed each frame.  
- **Particles** ‚Äì Streamlined particle rendering for combat, weather, and large-scale effects without FPS drops.  
- **Lighting** ‚Äì Reworked light update logic to avoid costly recalculations while keeping visuals accurate.  

Fastpath is not a replacement for Sodium‚Äîit‚Äôs a reinforcement. By strengthening Sodium‚Äôs foundation, it pushes performance further while preserving compatibility and visual quality.
